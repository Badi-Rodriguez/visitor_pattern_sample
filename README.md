# Visitor Pattern Sample (C++)

### What is the Visitor Pattern?

The **Visitor pattern** is a **behavioral design pattern** that allows you to separate an algorithm from the objects on which it operates. It enables you to add new operations to a group of related classes **without modifying their source code**, making it especially useful when the object structure is stable but you need to perform many unrelated operations on it.

The pattern involves two main components:

- **Visitor**: An object that implements operations to be performed on elements of the object structure.
- **Element (or Visitable)**: An object that accepts a visitor and lets it access its data through a common interface.

The **key benefit** of the Visitor pattern is **extensibility**. In real-world systems, modifying existing classes—especially those already in production—can be risky. The Visitor pattern mitigates this by enabling you to add new behaviors externally via visitor objects, **without changing the original class definitions**.

This is particularly useful in scenarios involving **polymorphism**, where different types of elements share a common interface. The Visitor pattern leverages **double dispatch**—a technique that determines the correct operation to perform based on both the visitor and the element types—ensuring that the right code runs for each combination.

> For example, if you have a collection of different shapes (circles, rectangles, triangles), you can use the Visitor pattern to add new operations like exporting to XML or calculating area, without changing the shape classes themselves.

## Why Use the Visitor Pattern?
- **Separation of concerns:** Keeps data structures and operations separate.
- **Open/Closed Principle:** Add new operations without changing existing classes.
- **Extensibility:** Easily introduce new behaviors for a family of objects.

## How is the Visitor Pattern Implemented Here?
This project demonstrates the Visitor pattern using a simple geometry example in C++. The code is modularized for clarity and maintainability.

### Key Components
- **Shapes:**
  - `Circle`, `Rectangle`, `Triangle`, and `CompoundShape` (a composite of shapes).
  - All shapes inherit from a common abstract base class.
- **Visitors:**
  - `AreaVisitor`: Calculates the area of each shape.
  - `XMLExportVisitor`: Exports each shape's data as XML.
- **Double Dispatch:**
  - Each shape implements an `accept` method that takes a visitor. The visitor then calls the appropriate method for that shape type.
- **Modular Structure:**
  - Each class and visitor is defined in its own header/source file for clarity.

### Example Flow
1. **Create shapes:** Instantiate various shapes (e.g., `Circle`, `Rectangle`, etc.).
2. **Create visitors:** Instantiate visitors for different operations (e.g., area calculation, XML export).
3. **Accept visitors:** Each shape calls `accept(visitor)`, which triggers the visitor's operation for that shape.

### Directory Structure
- All modularized code is in the `improved version` directory.
- The main directory contains a placeholder `main.cpp` that points users to the improved version.

## Summary
This project is a clear, modern C++ example of the Visitor pattern, showing how to:
- Separate operations from data structures
- Add new operations easily
- Keep code organized and maintainable
